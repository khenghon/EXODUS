# EXODUS

Script/screenplay(opening.doc Can be accessed on GitHub)

You start with a voiceover which acts as a backstory of the protagonist. We wanted to explore the past of the protagonist which acts as a mini prologue.
The game starts and you press E to open the door. You have to fight monsters and exit the ship and then you get to the mother which is right next to the ship and clear the enemies Over there. You also can choose to explore most of the planet too.
As soon as you defeat all the enemies, you get to interact with an ai voice another voice which when triggered acts as an epilogue and then we have the end credits montage with our very own song.
The voiceover cutscene was intentional to increase immersion and make things more ambiguous.
